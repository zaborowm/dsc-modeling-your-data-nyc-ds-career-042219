    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">A research question is a clear, focused, concise, complex and arguable question around which you center your research. You should ask a question about an issue that you are genuinely curious about. \n",

    "<img src=\"rs.png\" width=400>\n",
    "Research questions help you focus your analysis by providing a path through the iterative analytical process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to developing a research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose an interesting general topic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of a general topic might be “ Use of mobile phones in the American Teens” or “10 Most profitable products in first quarter of 2018.”\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do some preliminary research on the domain under examination. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having a good degree of domain knowledge around your analytical question will always help you advance your analysis with domain specific analytical decisions, importance and relationship of predictors and communicating the results back to pubic domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consider your audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most data science projects, your audience will be analysts or domain experts. Always keep your audience in mind when narrowing your topic and developing your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start asking questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have achieved all of above, start asking general “how” and “why” questions about your topic. For example, “ How do teens use mobile phones in their daily routines? ” or “ What makes a product profitable? ”. So you see a bit of domain knowledge creeping again. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluate your question. \n",
    "            \n",
    "Once you have an analytical question, you ask yourself if the question is clear? . Analytical questions must be as clear as possible in order to be effective in helping the analyst conduct and describe their analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Identify data required to build the model .\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you identify the data required to answer the question that you have posed. We have already seen independent and dependent variables in terms of model building ( We also call these predictors/features vs. target/outcomes). You need to describe Which variables do you expect to find important towards answering the question, as well as which target variable's behavior can best describe the outcome of the experiment. Here is a quick example to demonstrate how you would initially start setting up a model in terms of how some variables can be used either individually or combined , to investigate an outcome.  \n",

We also check for nonlinear relationships, Outliers, leverage points, level of association and possible Correlation among predictors to check for collinearity. \n"

    "* Check  the impact of collinearity? Can you ignore it?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Revision of the model mainly depends on how we choose our initial model and how we interpret the outcomes from the initial experiment. For regression specific analysis, specially when are dealing with multiple regression, multi-collinearity is always a big issue and it cant be avoided totally. Multicollinearity can also obsecure the effect of predictors in a regression mode.  We tend to revise a regression model based on the selection of predictors and how they tend to correlate with each other. \n",

    "* What factors explain the unexplained residual variation?\n",
    "* Removing several is dangerous if collinearity is present.\n",

The description of the model and its outcomes must always be in the terms of original analytical question asked. \n",
